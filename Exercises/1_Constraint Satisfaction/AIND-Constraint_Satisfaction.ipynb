    "# Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n",
    "---\n",
    "Constraint satisfaction is a general problem solving technique for solving a class of combinatorial optimization problems by imposing limits on the values in the solution. The goal of this exercise is to practice formulating some classical example problems as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), and then to explore using a powerful open source constraint satisfaction tool called [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) from Microsoft Research to solve them. Practicing with these simple problems will help you to recognize real-world problems that can be posed as CSPs; some solvers even have specialized utilities for specific types of problem (vehicle routing, planning, scheduling, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of CSP solvers available for CSPs. Z3 is a \"Satisfiability Modulo Theories\" (SMT) solver, which means that unlike the backtracking and variable assignment heuristics discussed in lecture, Z3 first converts CSPs to satisfiability problems then uses a [boolean satisfiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) (SAT) solver to determine feasibility. Z3 includes a number of efficient solver algorithms primarily developed to perform formal program verification, but it can also be used on general CSPs. Google's [OR tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/) includes a CSP solver using backtracking with specialized subroutines for some common CP domains.\n",

    "We'll start by exploring the Z3 module with a _very_ simple & classic CSP problem called cryptarithmetic. A cryptarithmetic puzzle is posed as an arithmetic equation made up of words where each letter represents a distinct digit in the range (0-9). (This problem has no practical significance in AI, but it is a useful illustration of the basic ideas of CSPs.) For example, consider the problem and one possible solution shown below:\n",

For example, in this case we could write a single large constraint combining all of the letters simultaneously $T\\times10^2 + W\\times10^1 + O\\times10^0 + T\\times10^2 + W\\times10^1 + O\\times10^0 = F\\times10^3 + O\\times10^2 + U\\times10^1 + R\\times10^0$. This kind of constraint works fine for some problems, but large constraints cannot usually be evaluated for satisfiability unless every variable is bound to a specific value. Expressing the problem with smaller constraints can sometimes allow the solver to finish faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can break out each pair of digits in the summands and introduce a carry variable for each column: $(O + O)\\times10^0 = R\\times10^0 + carry_1\\times10^1$ This constraint can be evaluated as True/False with only four values assigned.\n",
